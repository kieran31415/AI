These algorithms (based on recursion) consider **all** possible actions available at this time (a game tree) and then evaluate their future moves based on these options. The goal\n",
    "of the algorithm is of course to find the optimal set of moves that will help it arrive at the final and (most important) winning position. At the end of this lesson you will use the **Minimax algorithm** to program the unbeatable Tic Tac Toe (or Noughts and Crosses) game."
